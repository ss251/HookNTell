## Project Description

How might recreational fisherfolk achieve an online platform to report their catches  
in order to better serve accurate fish populations?
Our project plans to build a web-application that both acts as a tool to report fish catches to the state government the user resides in (initial focus on Washington) and an information portal that helps users discover popular fishing locations, events and equipment.
